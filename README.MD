**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** Fill "Input.txt" with the following information on specified line
- First line: Two real numbers n1 and n2, 0.00 < n1 ≤ n2 < 10.00 - lower and upper bounds of the
estimated profit of serving each customer in dollars
- Second line: Real number r, 0.00 < r < 1000.00 - cost of staffing a cashier counter per day in dollar
- Third line: Two integers i1 and i2, 30 < i1 ≤ i2 < 300 - lower and upper bounds of the average time
for a cashier to serve a customer in seconds
